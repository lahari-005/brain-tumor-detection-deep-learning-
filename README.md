Developed an automated brain tumor classification system using VGG16-based transfer learning on MRI images to classify glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor with high accuracy.
Applied data preprocessing, normalization, and augmentation to improve generalization and robustness.
Achieved F1-scores above 0.85 across classes and implemented a real-time prediction function with confidence outputs.
Explored future enhancements including model interpretability (Grad-CAM), multimodal integration, and deployment for real-time clinical diagnostics.
